Sure, letâ€™s look at one:

{{< highlight go >}}
type Writer interface {
  Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
{{< / highlight >}}

This is `Writer` type from standard library (from io package). If you want to implement such interface, you need to have struct with function `Write` defined on this struct.

Letâ€™s write some dummy implementation of this interface.

{{< highlight go >}}
type DummyWriter struct {}

func (dw DummyWriter) Write (p []byte) (int, error) {
  return 0, nil
}
{{< / highlight >}}

Here we have completely valid and extremely useless `Writer` implementation. I just wanted to show you that in golang, interface implementation is implicit. In order to satisfy interface, you need to have all of the method of the interface implemented on a struct. One struct can implement as much interfaces as it wants.

### Why does it matter?
In golang there is a rule of thumb that in function you should accept interfaces as parameters but return concrete implementations. So for example if you want to have a function that writes something to file, write a function that accepts `io.Writer` interface instead of `os.File` struct (which is `io.Writer` implementation by the way). Then if you want to test this function, you donâ€™t need to give it real File, you can give it any mock/dummy struct that implements `Write`.

Most important thing - naming interfaces:

- interface with function Write -> Writer
- Interface with Write and Close -> WriteCloser
- Interface with Read, Write and Seek -> ReadWriteSeeker
- Interface with Egnyte -> Egnyter

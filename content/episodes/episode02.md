If you want to make sure that something will happen, in go you can use `defer`. Statement marked with defer will be called at the end of enclosing function.

Examples from Docker project:

{{< highlight go >}}
defer os.RemoveAll(tmp) // inside test as clean-up step

defer ls.mountL.Unlock() // make sure to release acquired lock

defer f.Close() // close file after reading content

defer body.Close() // close HTTP response body after reading content

defer d.Stop() // stop a daemon 
{{< / highlight >}}

Very often defer is used at the beginning of the function, which is very different from usage of finally in other languages (again example from Docker):

{{< highlight go >}}
func (ps *Store) GetV2Plugin(refOrID string) (*v2.Plugin, error) {
  ps.RLock()
  defer ps.RUnlock()
  â€¦
}
{{< / highlight >}}

Since `Runlcok()` is deferred, it will for sure happen at the end.

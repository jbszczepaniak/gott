Operator `range` supports not only iterating over arrays, slices and maps but also over channels. Let's find out how it works under the hood.

{{< highlight go >}}
func main() {
    source := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
            source <- i         // Produce values from 0 to 4.
        }
        close(source)             // Necessary for range to work.
    }()

    for v := range source {      // Range over all values from source.
        fmt.Println(v)
    }
}
{{< / highlight >}}

Ranging over channel is merely syntactic sugar. In order to understand how this works underneath, one need to realize that channel receive operator (`<-chan`) when used in assignment yields two values:

{{< highlight go >}}
v, ok := channel
{{< / highlight >}}

First is value received from the channel itself. Second informs whether communication succeeded. This means that for not closed channel (values still to be received) `ok` will be `true`, and for closed channel it will be `false`. This is why closing a channel at the producer end is so important. Without it consumer doesn't know when to stop to receive from the channel.

{{< highlight go >}}
for {                            // Known as "while true" in other languages.
    v, ok := <-source 
    if !ok {                     // If there is no more values just stop.
        break
    }
    fmt.Println(v, ok)
}
{{< / highlight >}}

As you can see looping is just receiving value after value and checking whether channel is closed or not. However `range` keyword is shorter, more verbose and preferable.

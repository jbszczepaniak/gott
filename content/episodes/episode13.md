It is commonly known that struct types can implement interfaces, but did you know that any type can implement an interface?

An interface used when working with HTTP servers is `Handler`. It has one method `ServeHTTP` and every struct implementing this interface can be registered as a handler for incoming HTTP requests. This is simple implementation of `Handler` interface.

{{< highlight go >}}
type helloServer struct{}

func (s helloServer) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Write([]byte("hello")) // usually something useful is going on here...
}

//registration
http.Handle("/hello", helloHandler)
{{< / highlight >}}

Designers of the standard library also thought of a use case where function is register as a handler that will handle HTTP requests and the way they did it is quite astonishing.

{{< highlight go >}}
type HandlerFunc func(ResponseWriter, *Request)

func (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request) {
    f(w, r)
}
{{< / highlight >}}

When I first saw it, I couldn't understand it. Now it makes perfect sense and I find it clever. First of all there is a `HandlerFunc` type that is a proxy to the function which accepts `ResponseWriter` and `*Request`. Every function with that signature can be converted to the type `HandlerFunc`.
In the next line magic happens. There is `ServeHTTP` method defined on the `HandlerFunc` type and the only thing it does, it kind of calls itself. Since every type with `ServeHTTP` defined on it implements Handler interface therefore `HandlerFunc` type implements `Handler` interface. 

{{< highlight go >}}
func hiHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { w.Write([]byte("hi")) }

//registration
http.Handle("/hi", http.HandlerFunc(hiHandler))
{{< / highlight >}}

`http.Handle` accepts `Handler` as a second parameter, but since `hiHandler` can be converted to `HandlerFunc` which implements `Handler` - we can just use the function after converting it to `HandlerFunc`.

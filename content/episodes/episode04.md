{{< highlight go >}}
type HealthCheck struct {
  Interval   time.Duration
  Healthy    bool
}
func (hc HealthCheck) isHealthy() bool {
  return hc.Healthy
}
{{< / highlight >}}

Above you have what you could call a class. It is a struct though with function defined on it.

{{< highlight go >}}
check := HealthCheck{
  Interval: 2*time.Second,
  Healthy: true,
}
check2 := &HealthCheck{1*time.Second, true}
{{< / highlight >}}

Look-n-feel of the struct with function defined on it is class-like. You use it as object just like in other languages. Above there are two definitions. First is more verbose (it is called field:value initialization), in the second initialization is implicit (value) initialization.

There is also ampersand (&) symbol. It means that `check` is of type `HealthCheck` and `check2` is of type ‚Äúpointer to `HealthCheck`‚Äù. It matters a lot, but let‚Äôs not go into the details today. I will just say that you don‚Äôt have to care about pointers when accessing fields/functions:

{{< highlight go >}}
check.isHealthy()  // this gives true
check.Healthy      // this also gives true
check2.isHealthy() // gives also true
check2.Healthy     // surprise, surprise it gives true
{{< / highlight >}}

By the way did you know that there is no private/public keywords in go? If struct/function/variable starts with capital letter, you can use it outside of the package, if not - you can‚Äôt! `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

# You donâ€™t raise or throw exceptions, you return errors.
## [get pdf here ðŸ–¨](/gott/episode03.pdf)
There is a lot of code blocks like this in go:

{{< highlight go >}}
fileInfo, err := os.Stat(filename)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("could not stat file, err: %v", err)
}
{{< / highlight >}}

Each time you encounter a possibility of error you handle it immediately. You return it and let caller deal with it or you just log it and move on.

In golang errors are normal variables, â€‹error â€‹type is an interface with single method â€‹`Error()`â€‹. `â€‹Error()`â€‹ â€‹returns description of what happened.

Although you can define your own errors, more frequently people just use built-in ones and use messages to describe abnormal situations.

But If you want to check what type of error did you get, you can do it with technique called â€‹type assertionâ€‹:
 
{{< highlight go >}}
func someFunc() error {
	return &SomeError{} //Some defined earlier error
}
func main() {
	err := someFunc()
	if err != nil {
		_, ok := err.(*SomeError)
		if ok {
			fmt.Println("This is SomeError for sure")
		}
	}
}

{{< / highlight >}}

If this looks confusing do not worry, we will talk about type assertions in the future!

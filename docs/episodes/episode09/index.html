<p>One of the most powerful features of go is it&rsquo;s concurrency model built around goroutines and channels. <strong>Goroutine</strong> is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. <strong>Channel</strong> enables unidirectional communication between goroutines. If you want to know more about channels and goroutines, stay tuned - in upcoming episodes we will take a closer look at them.</p>

<p>One of the problems with concurrent programming is a data race. Data race is a situation where a state of a variable is being changed concurrently, which effects in indefinite state of the variable. As said before, golang wants you to be safe. Consider running your code with  <code>-race</code> flag. With this flag, golang builds a special instrumented binary, which warns you about every encountered data race event.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at an example, where a counter is increased 1000 times. Each write operation happens in a different goroutine.</p>

<span style="color:#111">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The result of running the example (using <code>go run -race main.go</code>) prints detailed report that states which goroutine, in which line of code causes data race. Another clue that the code doesn&rsquo;t behave in a deterministic fashion is that each execution provides a different result. It&rsquo;s worth to note that the production code we write is slightly more complex and spotting data races may be quite a challenge. It is a good practice to run your tests with <code>-race</code> flag to spot early some of non-obvious errors on CI pipeline.</p>

<p>In the next episode we will take a look at one of golangs proverb <em>&ldquo;Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.&rdquo;</em> Unfortunately here we&rsquo;ve seen communicating by sharing memory, which we will fix next time.</p>
